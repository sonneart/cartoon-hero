                <h2>About Filikos</h2>
                <p>Filikos is an <a target="_blank" href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:aasimar">Aasimar</a> <a
                        target="_blank" href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian">Barbarian</a>,
                    who grew up on the island of Ignakos. The island was once occupied by evil warmongering overlords,
                    forcing the population to mine the volcanic mines for materials to fuel the war on the mainland.
                    <br><br>
                    When a monk of Ilmater showed up, he instigated riots to liberate the population, and Filikos fell
                    in
                    love with him.
                    During these riots, Filikos fell, but was chosen by the god Tempus to fight once again, ressurecting
                    him
                    and giving him immense power for a moment.
                    During this he killed the overlord who enslaved the island, and was proclaimed the Hero of
                    Ignakos.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately the island had been exploited too much and the volcanic island exploded soon after,
                    killing most of the population, leaving only a few to survive, by taking boats to the mainland.
                    After this, Filikos proclaimed his love to the Monk of Ilmater, however the monk could not
                    reciprocate
                    Filikos' love as he was on a pilgrimage to better the world.

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Filikos is a happy-go-lucky and irrepressibly positive person. He cares strongly for his friends, and
                    will go to great lengths
                    to protect them. So much that he sometimes looses himself to carnage in an attempt to protect those
                    he
                    love. <br> <br>
                    He can at times be a bit overbearing and doting towards his comrades, but he always means well, and
                    does
                    his best to keep everyone safe.
